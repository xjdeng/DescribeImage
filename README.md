# DescribeImage

Under Construction



The goal of this module is to automatically provide a short description for an image using a pretrained model (in Keras.)

It'll be loosely based off of the [Image Captioning](https://github.com/yashk2810/Image-Captioning) repository but integrate with my [Easy_Facial_Recognition](https://github.com/xjdeng/Easy_Facial_Recognition) library.
